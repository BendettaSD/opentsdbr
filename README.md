opentsdb
========

This package provides a read-only interface from [R] to [OpenTSDB]. We're using it internally for data analysis on the [BEACON] project at UC Berkeley.

It's not optimized, and only uses HTTP, but could serve as a reference implementation (or straw man) for a faster and/or more fully featured API.

Seeking comment. If anyone would like to fork or contribute, please let me know!
